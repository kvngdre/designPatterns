# Design Patterns

## What are design pattern?

Design patterns are elegant solution to repeating problems in software design. They show you how you should structure your classes and how those classes should talk to each other.

## Design Patterns Categories

- **Creational Patterns**: They are about different ways to create objects.

- **Structural Patterns**: They are about the relationships between the objects.

- **Behavioural Patterns**: They are about the interaction or communication between the objects.

For my learning process I decided to use **C#**. Reason being I would like to improve my understanding and getting even more familiar with the language and also because it has incredible OOP support.
