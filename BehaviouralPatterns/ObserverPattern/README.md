# Observer Pattern

Also known as the **Publisher/Subscriber Pattern**. The observer pattern is a software design pattern where we have multiple objects (observers/subscribers) that are interested and need to be notified whenever their is a change in the state of a concrete subject (publisher) class or in simpler terms, a change in the interested state of the object they are observing.

Itâ€™s crucial that all subscribers implement the same interface and that the publisher communicates with them only via that interface. This interface should declare the notification method along with a set of parameters that the publisher can use to pass some contextual data along with the notification.

There are **four** actors you need to be aware of in the observer pattern:

- **`The Subject`**: This is a class where we handle the business of attaching, detaching, and notifying observers of changes. It exposes methods for new subscribers to join, old subscribers to join and a mechanism to notify subscribers of a particular event.

- **`The Concrete Subject`**: Also known as the Publisher, is a class that extends the abstract subject class and has field(s) that the observers are interested to know about. The publisher publishes an event when there is a change in it's state or executes some behaviour.

- **`The Observer`**: This is an interface or abstract class with a method for handling the action when change in the subject has been received. The method is usually called _update_ which might have other parameters about the event that occurred as passed by the publisher.

- **`The Concrete Observer`**: This is a class that implements/extends the observer. The business logic for handling the event of a subject value's change is defined in the implemented method.
